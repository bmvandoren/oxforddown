<!-- Flexibility in avian migration across scales -->


Movement links the lives of animals, plants and people to the ever-changing environments of our planet. Migratory birds embody this essence, captivating human imagination and study for millennia while conveying important information about the natural world. People have wondered about the comings and goings of migratory birds since the days of Aristotle [@waltersConciseHistoryOrnithology2003], and such long-running fascination is well-founded. Migratory birds engage in breathtaking feats of navigation, endurance, social coordination, and physiological transformation, culminating in one of nature's most inspiring phenomena [@alerstamBirdMigration1990; @newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008].

Today, birds serve as charismatic and accessible indicators of ecosystem health and biodiversity on a hemispheric scale [@canterburyBirdCommunitiesHabitat2000; @oconnellBirdGuildsIndicators2000; @gregoryDevelopingIndicatorsEuropean2005; @butchartGlobalBiodiversityIndicators2010]. In recent decades, birds' responses to pesticides, invasive species, human development, and climate change have led to detailed insight into the impacts of human activity on natural systems [@wursterBirdMortalitySpraying1965;  @gregoryIndicatorImpactClimatic2009; @butchartGlobalBiodiversityIndicators2010; @rosenbergDeclineNorthAmerican2019]. Birds provide key ecosystem services, transport nutrients and propagules, and participate in important trophic interactions [@whelanEcosystemServicesProvided2008; @bauerMigratoryAnimalsCouple2014]. Dangers faced by migratory birds signal broad risks for the natural world. 

Unfortunately, these travelers are disappearing under rapidly increasing pressures of a global change [@sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006; @bairleinMigratoryBirdsThreat2016; @rosenbergDeclineNorthAmerican2019]. Understanding the capacity of migratory birds to respond to both established and emerging challenges requires knowledge of the complex interactions among individuals, populations, species, and natural and built environments. Despite millennia of human fascination with migratory birds, we lack important understanding of the flexibility of avian migration across spatial and taxonomic scales, leaving a fundamental gap in our knowledge of this key part of avian life history.

<!-- Bird migration is a phenomenon that has captivated human imagination and study for millennia and one that provides important information about the natural world. Migratory birds connect continents and peoples, and they are charismatic and accessible indicator species for monitoring ecosystem health on a hemispheric scale (Bryce et al. 2002, Bock and Jones 2004, Devictor et al. 2010). Indeed, birds have already provided important insights into the effects we can expect from a changing climate on the natural world (Kullberg et al. 2015, Miles et al. 2017). Observed changes in the distributions and phenology of  migratory birds signal what will come for less mobile organisms (Walther et al. 2002). In order to accurately predict and ameliorate effects of climate change on the natural world, it is crucial to understand organisms’ flexibility in their movement behaviours.  -->

<!-- Unfortunately, these global travelers are disappearing under rapidly increasing pressures of habitat loss, climate change, and an airspace transformed by light pollution, emergent structures, and vehicles [3–5]. Understanding the complex interactions among individuals, populations, species, and natural and built environments is crucial to identifying ways to ameliorate these impacts. Despite millennia of human fascination with migratory birds, we have little knowledge of how the various components of migration systems fit together, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of a key period in the avian annual cycle. -->


## Challenges of a changing world {-}

<!-- (- Their global existance makes birds succeptible) -->

Migrants' finely tuned, worldwide existance makes them susceptible to rapid global change. To be successful, a migratory bird must meet a diverse array of challenges: navigating through a dynamic aymosphere; accurately timing departure, stopovers, and arrival; efficiently locating resources *en route*; and thriving in diverse ecological contexts [@newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008]. The requirement of integrating these and other components of migration implies that responses to change may require adjustment of multiple stages of the migratory process. Birds' abilities to adapt may vary greatly by species and migratory stage. Depending on the nature of the environmental change, some species may have little problem adapting, while others may struggle [@sutherlandEvidenceFlexibilityConstraint1998; @bothAdjustmentClimateChange2001; @crickImpactClimateChange2004].

<!-- (- Summarize threats and changes) -->

Migratory birds face a variety of threats. The habitats birds evolved to occupy are undergoing rapid alterations, caused by habitat loss, climate change, and a proliferation of vehicles, built structures, and artificial lighting. Major drivers of terrestrial land cover change include agriculture, deforestation and urbanization [@lambinCausesLanduseLandcover2001]. Aerial habitats are also changing, as the numbers of airplanes and skyscrapers rise and populations of insects dwindle [@hallmannMore75Percent2017; @diehlExtendingHabitatConcept2017; @stepanianDeclinesAbundantAquatic2020]. For the billions of migratory birds that migrate at night [@newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008], light pollution compounds this crisis; artificial lighting draws migratory birds into urban areas and is directly responsible for fatal collisions with built structures [@allenDestructionBirdsLighthouses1880; @mclarenArtificialLightNight2018; @laoInfluenceArtificialLight2020]. Climate change is also contributing to transformed habitats while shifting optimal timing windows and weather patterns [@dunnEffectsClimateChange2019]. All of these forces have major consequences for migratory birds, contributing to direct and indirect mortality and threatening the integrity of entire ecosystems [@lossDirectMortalityBirds2015; @rosenbergDeclineNorthAmerican2019]. As environmental change proceeds and humans modify both the landscapes through which birds pass and the areas where they breed and winter, a migratory strategy may become increasingly untenable [@wilcoveGoingGoingGone2008;@rungeProtectedAreasGlobal2015]. 
<!-- Migratory birds are in decline across the globe [@sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006; @bairleinMigratoryBirdsThreat2016; @rosenbergDeclineNorthAmerican2019]. -->

<!-- [@beresfordPhenologyClimateChange;@bothAvianPopulationConsequences2009;@fraserIndividualVariabilityMigration2019; @sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006].  -->

<!-- (- Already seeing some responses) -->

Fortunately, many species are responding to global change in detectable ways. As the arrival of spring has grown earlier, so too have the spring arrival dates of many migratory bird species [@usuiTemporalShiftsTemperature2017]. As locations with suitable climatic conditions have shifted, so too have birds' geographic ranges [@lasortePolewardShiftsWinter2007; @tingleyPushPullClimate2012]. In some cases, migratory routes have changed or individuals have stopped migrating entirely, as birds take advantage of new and changing resource regimes [@visserClimateChangeLeads2009; @elmbergInterpretingSeasonalRange2014; @chengCloserHomeStrategy2019]. It is evident that many bird species possess an ability to rapidly respond to environmental change. At the same time, other species appear to be relatively rigid in their behavior, prompting concerns that even some of the world's most mobile animals will fail to adapt in time [e.g. @bothAdjustmentClimateChange2001]. We lack knowledge of the flexibility of migratory birds, and this knowledge is crucial to answering this question.

<!-- Moreover, what will come of less vagile organisms, many of which birds rely on for food and shelter? -->
<!-- (- But is it enough? How flexible are birds...) -->

  
## Flexibility in migration {-}
  
The migrations of birds are highly diverse journeys, undertaken by individuals responding to---and often predicting---changing conditions. Variation in migratory behavior is present at all taxonomic levels, and even within species and populations. Movements may be long- or short-distance, obligate or facultative, regular or irregular, performed singly or in groups, and rigidly timed or conditions-dependent [@newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008]. This diversity in migratory strategies mirrors large variation in the degree of flexibility migrants demonstrate as they interact with and respond to the natural world. Flexibility makes successful migration possible, and it manifests at multiple levels: migrants must interact with the atmosphere during active flight, find suitable terrestrical conditions during stopover, and match the timing of breeding to local resource availability. Over the long term, populations and species must also respond to environmental change. 

<!-- Short-term flexibility -- immediate response to environment during active migration -->

### Interacting with a dynamic atmosphere {-}

Migratory birds respond to variation in their environment in a variety of ways. During active migration, birds move through a dynamic atmosphere, a flowing medium that often moves faster than a bird can fly. Atmospheric dynamics are highly changeable, and they can strongly influence a bird's flight trajectory, energy expenditure, and ultimately its survival [@richardsonTimingBirdMigration1990]. All avian navigators most possess the capability to effectively and efficiently interact with a variable atmosphere, or risk costly detours. Indeed, birds are frequently selective with the time, direction, and altitude of their movements [@schmaljohannTransSaharaMigrantsSelect2009; @dokterHighAltitudeBird2013]. The decision to migrate is influenced strongly by wind and weather conditions, as birds select departure times with favorable or even optimal conditions for progress towards their goal [@akessonWindSelectivityMigratory2000; @erniWindRainGovern2002]. Yet prevailing wind regimes and the time pressure of a relentlessly advancing calendar mean that birds cannot always be selective. As powered fliers, birds have the ability to partially or fully compensate for wind drift incurred during migratory flights, and they show complex interactions with moving atmospheric flows. Frequently, birds adopt a compensatory strategy, and the degree to which migrants fight the wind is influenced by a range of factors, including age, body size and condition, time pressure, wind conditions, and the potential dangers of being drifted off course [@liechtiBirdsBlowinWind2006; @alerstamOptimalBirdMigration2011; @chapmanAdaptiveStrategiesNocturnally2016; @hortonNocturnallyMigratingSongbirds2016]. Migrants respond not only to wind but also to temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure [@richardsonTimingBirdMigration1990], cues that may contain predictive information both about the conditions they will experience *en route* and on arrival. As weather conditions may change quickly, migrants must be flexible enough to stay on course and minimize delays. 

<!-- Examples?? -->

<!-- Medium-term flexibility -- adjusting of e.g. timing based on environmental cues, like a colder or warmer spring.  -->

### Adjusting to a variable environment {-}

The seasonal return movements that characterize classic migratory behavior are an adaptation to a variable environment, where fluctuations in resource availability are regular, predictable, and severe [@wingerLongWinterRed2018]. Indeed, the changing of the seasons is one of few truly predictable phenomena on earth. Yet on top of regular annual cycles, there is considerable variation from year to year in how seasons manifest: in their exact timing, their harshness, and the biotic responses of plant and animal communities. Moreover, recent climatic changes have brought on increased volatility in seasonal patterns and more frequent extremes [@ipccClimateChange20142014].

Migratory birds thrive by using movement to escape harsh environments. For example, some species move extreme distances to experience perpetual summer [@shafferMigratoryShearwatersIntegrate2006; @newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008]. In order to track seasonal changes that are themselves variable, migrants must demonstrate sufficient flexibility. Such phenotypic plasticity manifests in the adjustments birds make to the timing of migration and breeding in order to match faster or slower spring phenology [@charmantierAdaptivePhenotypicPlasticity2008; @charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014; @usuiTemporalShiftsTemperature2017], as well as in range shifts in response to variable conditions [e.g. @batemanImportanceRangeEdges2015]. In partially migratory populations, some individuals migrate while others stay on the breeding grounds. The drivers of these decisions are not always clear, but they are likely related to a suite of environmental, social, and demographic factors [@chapmanEcologyEvolutionPartial2011]. A suite of Australian species take rapid responses to variable conditions to the extreme, reacting to distant precipitation events by engaging in long movements to exploit ephemeral wetlands [@pedlerLongdistanceFlightsHighrisk2018]. A number of patterns emerge from this wide continuum of variation: for example, long-distance migrants, which rely on programmed circannual clocks to time migration, are generally less flexible than short-distance migrants that generally time their movements in response to environmental cues [@newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008]. 

  <!-- + Migration is an adaptation to a variable environment [**ref Winger**] -->
  <!-- + Seasons are generally predictable, as predictable as the number of rotations the earth will complete in 365 days -->
  <!-- + Yet there is considerable variation from year to year -- and with climate change, we are seeing increased variability as well, e.g. with the time of spring -->
  <!-- + Birds must exhibit flexibility that allow them to respond  -->
  <!-- + Phenotypic plasticity well documented in some migratory birds - timing advances with climate change, range shifts  -->
  <!--   + Examples: timing of migration, timing of breeding, stopping of migration (storks) -->
  <!-- + Short-distance migrants are the most flexible  -->
  <!-- + Long-distance migrants are not that flexible -->

<!-- Longer-term flexibility -- evolutionary change to changing climatic regimes and land use paradigms, ice age, range expansion - recapitulation of migratory routes -->

### Adapting to long-term change {-}

<!-- @vanbuskirkPhenotypicPlasticityAlone2012 -->
<!-- @schmaljohannLimitsModifyingMigration2017 -->
<!-- @charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014 -->
<!-- @gienappResponsesClimateChange2007 - unclear -->
To cope with long-term environmental modifications, such as climate change and habitat transformation, migrants cannot generally rely on phenotypic plasticity. In many bird species, including passerine migrants, the innate circannual clock exerts substantial control over the timing of annual cycle events such as moult, migration, and reproduction [@gwinnerCircannualClocksAvian1996]. In long-distance migrants, endogenous control of these events is particularly strong, and these species often show remarkable consistency in migration timing among years, even in the face of varying conditions. In addition, the juveniles of most migratory species are not accompanied by experienced individuals on their first migration and must rely on some degree of genetic programming to find their way [@newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008]. The suite of endogenous mechanisms that control migration is known as the migratory programme, and adjustment of this innate system requires evolutionary change. It is easy to observe the footprint of evolutionary change on migration today, in routes that recapitulate post-glacial expansions [e.g. @rueggClimateChangeOrigin2006]; sedentary species with migratory ancestors [e.g. @wingerAncestryEvolutionSeasonal2012]; and innate timing and navigation programmes. However, because adjustment of the migratory programme requires hard-coded evolutionary change, it is unclear whether rigidly-timed species will be able to match the current pace of environmental shifts, and whether microevolution is at work in the responses we observe today [@gienappResponsesClimateChange2007; @charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014; @vanbuskirkPhenotypicPlasticityAlone2012]. 

<!-- The relatively slow speed at which microevolution can act -->

<!--   + Long term environmental changes like climate change, ice age cycles, new habitat -- cannot rely on plasticity, need evolutionary change -->
<!--   + Long distance migrants have rigidly programmed timing programmes, in addition to inherited navigation programs  -->

<!--     + Evidence for innate control of migration -->
<!--     + Differs by migratory strategy, distance, species -->
<!--     + Chronobiology perspectives  -->
<!--     + Often viewed as the rigid and programmed aspect - instinct driven -->
<!--     + But evidence that there may actually be more flexibility here than believed  -->
<!--       + Factors like age (juv vs adult), migration distance/strategy -->
<!--       + Partial migration - do individuals with different strategies have different programs, or different thresholds, or...? -->
<!--       + How is the migratory programme inherited?  -->
<!--     + Migratory programmed believed to be rigid, only possible to respond to evolutionary changes  -->
<!--       + What potential is there for evolutionary change?  -->


<!--   + Yet it is unclear the extent to which evolution is actually occurring -->
<!--   + We see clear marks of evolution in migration today - routes that are shadows of expansions since last glacial maximum, i.e. that recapitulate historical routes despite being non-optimal; "drop-out" species that have ceased migrating; innate programming of clocks and directions -- all bear the unmistakable mark of evolution -->
<!--   + But the question today is whether evolutionary processes are occurring fast enough to match the pace of change -->
<!--     + Examples from studies that seem to show - but hard without experimental approaches -->

<!-- The diversity in migratory strategies is mirrored in the ease with which individual can adapt to change -->

<!-- but they are particularly susceptible to environmental change because successful migration requires the integration of a number of disparate components, each one sensitive to ongoing changes that may be poorly correlated. Migrants must time their journeys precisely, navigate accurately through a dynamic atmosphere, locate resources safely, reliably and efficiently, and thrive in ecological contexts that differ across seasons and hemispheres. As climate change shifts optimal timing windows, wind regimes, storm patterns, and as humans modify both the landscapes through which birds pass and the areas where they breed and winter, a migratory strategy may become increasingly untenable [@wilcoveGoingGoingGone2008;@rungeProtectedAreasGlobal2015]. Migrant birds are in decline in multiple regions, in part because many lack the flexibility to rapidly respond and adapt to these large scale environmental changes [@beresfordPhenologyClimateChange;@bothAvianPopulationConsequences2009;@fraserIndividualVariabilityMigration2019; @sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006].  -->

<!-- Whether migratory species have the capacity to adjust to rapid change is a focal question of current research. Although plasticity in response to climate change is well documented [@gienappResponsesClimateChange2007; @usuiTemporalShiftsTemperature2017], many migratory birds, especially long-distance travelers, rely on innate timing and navigational programs with limited flexibility [@akessonTimingAvianLongdistance2017; @gwinnerCircannualClocksAvian1996]. These programs must undergo evolution for adjustments to be realized. There is some evidence that microevolutionary change---not just plasticity---may be occuring, but it is unclear whether this can match the pace of warming [@helmEvolutionaryResponseClimate2019; @vanbuskirkPhenotypicPlasticityAlone2012;@charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014; @merilaClimateChangeAdaptation2014]. As changes continue, species will not only need to shift timing but also undergo large-scale distributional changes to track suitable conditions. Climate-induced range shifts have been documented in birds [@ambrosiniClimateChangeLongterm2011; @lehikoinenNorthNorthwestClimate2016; @lasortePolewardShiftsWinter2007; @tingleyPushPullClimate2012], but we lack an understanding of the ecological and behavioral processes that facilitate these shifts. This poses a challenge for predicting how species will respond in the future. -->


## Migration across scales {-}

Understanding multifaceted natural processes is best approached from multiple perspectives, and avian migration is no exception. Migratory birds form an interconnected network with multiple layers of complexity. The migratory phenotype of an individual is influenced by a range of internal and external factors, from genes and developmental processes to social environments and atmospheric conditions. At the same time, a population of migratory birds might occupy habitats across the world at different times of year, and hundreds of species interact to form hemispheric migration systems. Understanding bird migration requires that we think across scales, from individuals to systems. 

The individual is the fundamental unit of a migration system. It is important to recognize that each individual will possess an underlying migratory programme, influenced by a suite of factors. The most obvious determinant of its innate migratory tendency is its species identity, stemming from the genetic architecture it shares with conspecifics. Population identity may also be important in certain cases, especially for species that show strong migratory connectivity by breeding population [see @websterLinksWorldsUnraveling2002]. Individuals are influenced by their immediate social and kin relations as well as individual experience, health, and demographics [@newtonMigrationEcologyBirds2008; @briedismartinsMigratoryConnectivityContext2018]. Finally, each individual experiences a unique combination of environmental conditions, dictated by location, behavior, and physical traits. All of these factors contribute to the migratory phenotype of an individual. An individual perspective is therefore essential to understanding the drivers of variation in migratory behaviour. 

At the same time, an individual-based perspective is insufficient to address some of the most pressing scientific questions of today, which require a wider view on natural systems. Widespread and ongoing population declines among migrants warrant species-level perspectives. In addition to direct conservation, simply understanding how populations interact with human society and respond to global change will require studies with global scope, as environments and the changes they are experiencing are resoundingly heterogeneous. A wider view on bird migration is necessary to capture continental movement patterns, study how migration networks behave in the face of habitat loss, identify conservation bottlenecks, and quantify demographic trends [see @dokterSeasonalAbundanceSurvival2018]. 

Therefore, a modern understanding of bird migration requires integrating the behaviour of individuals, populations, species, and even entire hemispheric migration systems. Migratory systems facilitate large scale fluxes of biomass and transport of nutrients, with consequences for ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, pathogen and parasite transport, and biotic interactions from competition to pollination. In addition, migratory bird species are vastly interconnected. During migration, migrants form mixed species groups during active flight [@larkinEvidenceWidelyDispersed2008] and foraging and stopover periods [@rodewaldHabitatUseBehavior2002]. Many species give vocalizations in both contexts [@farnsworthFlightCallsTheir2005], but the extent of their function is poorly known. What is clear is that migratory bird species form an interconnected, global system, requiring study across scales. To only study migration from one point of view would be to miss important components of avian biology. 

Multiple perspectives are important not only in scale, but also in approach. Avian migration should not be thought of from exclusively ecological, behavioural, or evolutionary points of view. In this thesis, I attempt to improve our understanding of the flexibility of avian migration across spatial scales, taxonomic groups, and disciplines.

<!--   + Migratory birds are *individuals* that make decisions, integrating internal programming, internal need, external environmental/social stimuli -- to understand migration and flexibility, responses to climate change, and overall how things work, need to understand how individuals operate.

Migratory birds form a system of large scale biomass flux and nutrient transport, with consequences for ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, pathogen and parasite transport (e.g. ticks, disease), biotic interactions (pollination). Plus, migratory birds are interconnected. Species move together, communicate in migration, forage in mixed species flocks, and we have little understanding of these links. Migratory birds form part of a global system. To only study migration from an individual perspective would be to miss these important components of avian biology. -->

## Approaches to studying migration {-}

The methods used to study migration are nearly as diverse as the phenomenon itself. Ringing is one of the oldest means of tracking individual birds; since 1909, millions of birds have been ringed in the United Kingdom alone, and these marked birds have been recaptured over 500,000 times [@wernhamMigrationAtlasMovements2002]. Around the world, ringing has led to invaluable insight into the movements, longevity, and ecology of thousands of bird species. In addition, colorful rings designed to be read in the field by observers---not only on a bird in the hand---allow marked individuals to be monitored in the field without disturbance, making possible detailed observations of individual behaviour. 

Tracking technology using Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and smaller light-level geolocators [@lisovskiGeolocationLightAccuracy2012; @rakhimberdievComparingInferencesSolar2016; @ekstromAdvanceGeolocationLight2004] is well enough miniaturised to enable the tracking of all but the very lightest bird species. However, for birds under 20 g, representing thousands of species, only archival light-level geolocators are sufficiently lightweight [@lopez-lopezIndividualbasedTrackingSystems2016]; these devices must be physically recovered to obtain the data. Nevertheless, these devices allow scientists to monitor migratory birds daily in the wild, leading to a multitude of invaluable insights [@mckinnonTenYearsTracking2018].

Tracking technology allows scientists to study migratory phenotypes as they manifests in wild populations. Yet, migratory phenotypes may be strongly influenced by environmental conditions, which can be widely variable in the wild. Some questions therefore require experimental approaches in a laboratory setting, especially those pertaining to the innate migratory programme. Lab-based studies of migratory restlessness assay the behaviour of migrants in captivity, which is relatively well correlated with activity in the wild [@bertholdBirdMigrationGeneral2001]. The major advantage of a captive approach is that investigators can place birds under standardized, "common garden" conditions, in order to remove environmental variation as a source of observed phenotypic differences. 

Today, biologists are making increasing use of large datasets to study animal behavior and ecology. For decades, ornithologists have used various types of radar to study birds in active migration [@gauthreauxRadarOrnithologyBiological2003]. Doppler weather surveillance radars scan huge regions of airspace and form the basis of many governmental weather monitoring and prediction services. In the United States, the NEXt Generation RADar network (NEXRAD) has been operating since the mid-1990s, and analyses of these data have yielded important insights into the North American bird migration system [@gauthreauxRadarOrnithologyBiological2003; @farnsworthCharacterizationAutumnNocturnal2016; @dokterSeasonalAbundanceSurvival2018]. 

In this thesis, I combine this suite of approaches to study avian migration. I use data from captive studies to study the migratory programme, use data from radar and individual tracking devices to explore the variation and flexibility of migration at boh local and continental scales, and I use ringing recovery and visual resight data to study the wintering ecology of a migratory bird.

  <!--   + Big question: how does the migratory programme relate to actual migration in the wild? Methods may not be perfect - Zug != migration in the wild.  -->
  <!--   + Approaches that explore interspecies/population differences in restlessness and integrates these captive assays to behavior in the wild are particularly valuable for understanding their use in the future -->

## Geographic and taxonomic scope {-}

Like so many migratory birds, this thesis connects disparate regions of the world. I focus on representatives of two hemispheric migration systems, the Palearctic-Afrotropical and Nearctic-Neotropical migration systems. From the Palearctic-Afrotropical migration system, I study three migratory passerine songbirds: stonechats (family Muscicapidae, genus *Saxicola*), pied flycatchers (family Muscicapidae, *Ficedula hypoleuca*), and Eurasian blackcaps (family Sylviidae, *Sylvia atricapilla*). Stonechats and blackcaps show large variation in migratory strategies across populations and subtaxa, making them useful study systems for understanding migratory flexiblity. Pied flycatchers are obligate long-distance migrants, and are therefore ideal for studying migratory evolution in a rigidly timed species. My studies of the Nearctic-Neotropical migration system focus on understanding the ecology of entire migration assemblages and are not taxon-specific. 

## Thesis outline {-}

The aim of this thesis is to investigate the drivers of change and flexibility in avian migration across scales, from the individual bird to the hemispheric migration system. I focus on three themes, each comprising two chapters: (1) the innate migratory programme and its potential for evolutionary change, (2) continent-scale perspectives on processes driving flexibility and evolution in migration systems, and (3) the impact of human activity on migratory birds' behaviour both in flight and across generational timescales. 

All characteristics of species and systems are emergent properties of their constituent individuals. For migratory birds, studying the drivers of behaviour at the individual level is important to understanding the flexibility of entire species and assemblages. Therefore, in **Chapter \@ref(stonechats)**, I investigate individual variation in the innate migratory programme in closely related stonechat taxa that show divergent migratory strategies. I use data from laboratory studies of individuals raised in a common garden setting and develop an objective analysis approach based on changepoint analysis for quantifying restlessness data. I compare results from lab-based assays to migration behaviour in the wild, including study of a population with a partially migratory phenotype in the wild. I also examine flexibility and evolutionary potential in this phenotype by investigating how restlessness behaviour varies across age and sex classes and comparing phenotypes of hybrid individuals with those of their parents. 

<!-- I show that migration distance in the wild is closely associated with the intensity of nocturnal migratory restlessness measured in the lab, and that hybrid individuals possess intermediate timing and intensity phenotypes relative to parental populations. These results support a strong genetic basis for migratory behaviour in stonechats. However, I also found that Irish stonechats, which comprise both migratory and non-migratory individuals in the wild, display unexpectedly high levels of nocturnal migratory activity, indistinguishable from those of long-distance migrants from Siberia. This surprising result suggests that these partial migrants do not possess a genetic switch for migration and that environmental factors can strongly influence their migration phenotype in the wild.  -->


<!-- Understanding the influence of environmental conditions on bird migration is crucial given recent evidence for climate-linked changes in migratory behavior.  -->

A large component of songbirds' migratory behaviour is under genetic control, especially for obligate long-distance migrants with rigid timing programmes [@liedvogelGeneticsMigration2014]. Although these species have shown evidence of recent climate-linked changes in migration, the role of microevolution in these adjustments is poorly understood. In most instances, climate-related shifts can be explained by phenotypic plasticity alone [@charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014]. Knowing whether microevolution also plays a role is vital to the conservation of long-distance migrants, whose adaptation to climate change may be constrained by rigid timing programs. The pied flycatcher is a well-studied example of a long-distance migrant responding to climate change, yet the answer to this question is unclear in this species [@bothFlexibilityTimingAvian2010]. In **Chapter \@ref(flycatchers)**, I use data from a common garden study replicated in 1981 and 2002 to test whether pied flycatchers have evolved changes in their timing program. I then compare the results in laboratory-tested birds to advances documented in a local wild breeding population, with the goal of understanding whether the internal clock of this long-distance migrant may be more flexible than previously believed. 

Although studies in the laboratory are unique in their ability to control for environmental variation, it is equally important to understand variation in migratory behavior in wild populations. In **Chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)**, I retain a focus on individual migratory behaviour but shift to a wild context. I use the blackcap, a species with a long history of migration study and broad variation in migratory phenotype across its range [@crampSylviaAtricapillaBlackcap1992]. I use light-level geolocators to examine migratory behavior across the European continent, focusing on two salient features of blackcap migration. The first is a migratory divide present in central Europe, a zone of contact between populations with opposing autumn migratory directions [@helbigInheritanceMigratoryDirection1991; @helbigPopulationDifferentiationMigratory1992; @helbigSESWmigratingBlackcap1991]. I investigate patterns of migratory behavior at the divide to understand how migratory direction varies across this contact zone and how natural selection may be operating on different phenotypes. The second salient feature of blackcap migration is the recent emergence of a new wintering population in Britain, a potential consequence of human activity [@bearhopAssortativeMatingMechanism2005; @bertholdMigratoryBehaviourPopulation1988; @bertholdRapidMicroevolutionMigratory1992; @leachWinteringBlackcapsBritain1981]. I use geolocators to identify the source areas of these British winterers, compare these novel migrations to those of birds wintering in traditional Mediterranean areas, and examine the potential for reproductive isolation based on the timing of migration. 

Chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo) illustrates how studies across large spatial scales can reveal important insight into the processes governing transgenerational migratory evolution in a bird species. Yet the entire avian assemblages that traverse continents must also respond rapidly to changeable conditions *en route*. In **Chapter \@ref(forecast)**, I focus on capturing how an entire migration system  comprising billions of individuals actively responds to environmental conditions. Using a 23-year dataset derived from Doppler weather surveillance radars, I train a machine learning model to learn associations between migration and weather conditions across the contiguous United States. I examine the accuracy with which this model can forecast migratory movements days in advance, and I interpret learned associations to reveal the factors birds respond to most readily during spring migration. I also discuss the potential conservation and outreach applications of migration forecasting.

As nocturnally migrating birds traverse the landscape, they are increasingly exposed to a stimulus virtually unknown in their evolutionary histories: artificial light. Inputs of artificial light affect a range of taxa [@gastonEcologicalImpactsNighttime2013]. For passerine migrants, this new stimulus may dramatically affect their ability to interact normally with their environment, causing many to approach and potentially collide with man-made structures. In addition, light pollution may influence how migratory birds interact with the landscape across broad scales [@mclarenArtificialLightNight2018]. In **Chapter \@ref(lights)**, I investigate how a single, extremely bright light source in an urban area can drastically alter birds' migratory behaviour, and I give recommendations for ameliorating these negative effects. 

As Chapter \@ref(lights) demonstrates, the influence of the Anthropocene on migratory birds can be profound. Not only does human activity affect migratory birds during active migration, but it can shape the ecology of entire populations---provided they are able to take advantage of new resources and opportunities. The blackcap is one of few migratory species flexible enough to thrive in this changing world, and the recently established population of blackcaps wintering in the British Isles well illustrates the species' ability to rapidly respond to newly suitable conditions. In **Chapter \@ref(blackcap-uk)**, I discuss the broad footprint of human activity on the wintering ecology of blackcap in the British Isles. I investigate the associations between blackcaps and humans on a landscape scale, and I analyze a large dataset of observations from British gardens to study how these warblers interact with supplementary food provided by people.


Finally, in the **General Discussion**, I synthesize the work discussed in Chapters \@ref(stonechats)--\@ref(blackcap-uk) and discuss future promising avenues for study.
