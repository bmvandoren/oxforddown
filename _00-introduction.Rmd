<!-- Flexibility in avian migration across scales -->


Movement links the lives of animals, plants and people to the ever-changing environments of our planet. Migratory birds embody this essence, captivating human imagination and study for millennia while conveying important information about the natural world. [*Some historical anecdotes about the observation of birds - from Aristotle, more recently*]. Such long-running fascination is well-founded, as migratory birds engage in breathtaking feats of navigation, endurance, social coordination, and physiological transformation, culminating in one of the natural world's most inspiring phenomena.

Today, birds serve as charismatic and accessible indicators of ecosystem health on a hemispheric scale [**refs**]. In recent decades, studies documenting birds' responses to pesticides [ref DDT, neonicitonoids?], invasive species, human development, and climate change [**refs for all**] have led to detailed insight into the impacts of human activity on natural systems. Dangers faced by migratory birds signal broad risks for the natural world because they provide key services [**ref**] and form integral parts of ecosystems through trophic interactions and the transport of nutrients and propagules [@bauerMigratoryAnimalsCouple2014].

Unfortunately, these global travelers are disappearing under rapidly increasing pressures of a changing world. Understanding the capacity of migratory birds to respond to both established and emerging challenges requires knowledge of the complex interactions among individuals, populations, species, and natural and built environments. Despite millennia of human fascination with migratory birds, we lack an understanding of the flexibility of avian migration across spatial and taxonomic scales, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of this key period in avian life history.

During seasonal migrations, birds form intricate networks of hundreds of species and billions of individuals that fly, forage and communicate, interacting with each other while providing critical services to ecosystems [1].  -->

<!-- Bird migration is a phenomenon that has captivated human imagination and study for millennia and one that provides important information about the natural world. Migratory birds connect continents and peoples, and they are charismatic and accessible indicator species for monitoring ecosystem health on a hemispheric scale (Bryce et al. 2002, Bock and Jones 2004, Devictor et al. 2010). Indeed, birds have already provided important insights into the effects we can expect from a changing climate on the natural world (Kullberg et al. 2015, Miles et al. 2017). Observed changes in the distributions and phenology of  migratory birds signal what will come for less mobile organisms (Walther et al. 2002). In order to accurately predict and ameliorate effects of climate change on the natural world, it is crucial to understand organisms’ flexibility in their movement behaviours.  -->

<!-- Unfortunately, these global travelers are disappearing under rapidly increasing pressures of habitat loss, climate change, and an airspace transformed by light pollution, emergent structures, and vehicles [3–5]. Understanding the complex interactions among individuals, populations, species, and natural and built environments is crucial to identifying ways to ameliorate these impacts. Despite millennia of human fascination with migratory birds, we have little knowledge of how the various components of migration systems fit together, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of a key period in the avian annual cycle. -->


## Challenges of a changing world {-}

<!-- (- Their global existance makes birds succeptible) -->

Migrants' global existance makes them susceptible to changes occuring in different places at different scales, possibly with little correlation among them. A successful migrant must succeed at a diverse array of challenges: navigating through a dynamic aymosphere; accurately timing departure, arrival and stopover; efficiently locating resources en route; and thriving in diverse ecological contexts. The requirement of integrating these and other components of migration implies that responses to change may require adjusting multiple stages of the migratory processes. Flexibility may vary greatly among stages and species. Depending on the nature of the environmental changes experienced, some may have little problem adjusting, while others may struggle to adapt. 

<!-- (- Summarize threats and changes) -->

Migratory birds face a variety of challenges, including of habitat loss, climate change, and an airspace transformed by light pollution, emergent structures, and vehicles [**refs - 3–5**].

The migrations of birds are highly diverse journeys, undertaken by individuals responding to---and often predicting--changing conditions. Variation in migratory behavior is immense at all taxonomic levels, and even within species and populations. Movements may be long- or short-distance, obligate or facultative, regular or irregular, performed singly or in groups, and rigidly timed or conditions-dependent. 

This extreme diversity in migratory strategies is mirrored by large variation in responses to global change.   


The diversity in migratory strategies is mirrored in the ease with which individual can adapt to change


but they are particularly susceptible to environmental change because successful migration requires the integration of a number of disparate components, each one sensitive to ongoing changes that may be poorly correlated. Migrants must time their journeys precisely, navigate accurately through a dynamic atmosphere, locate resources safely, reliably and efficiently, and thrive in ecological contexts that differ across seasons and hemispheres. As climate change shifts optimal timing windows, wind regimes, storm patterns, and as humans modify both the landscapes through which birds pass and the areas where they breed and winter, a migratory strategy may become increasingly untenable [@wilcoveGoingGoingGone2008;@rungeProtectedAreasGlobal2015]. Migrant birds are in decline in multiple regions, in part because many lack the flexibility to rapidly respond and adapt to these large scale environmental changes [@beresfordPhenologyClimateChange;@bothAvianPopulationConsequences2009;@fraserIndividualVariabilityMigration2019; @sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006]. 

Whether migratory species have the capacity to adjust to rapid change is a focal question of current research. Although plasticity in response to climate change is well documented [@gienappResponsesClimateChange2007; @usuiTemporalShiftsTemperature2017], many migratory birds, especially long-distance travelers, rely on innate timing and navigational programs with limited flexibility [@akessonTimingAvianLongdistance2017; @gwinnerCircannualClocksAvian1996]. These programs must undergo evolution for adjustments to be realized. There is some evidence that microevolutionary change---not just plasticity---may be occuring, but it is unclear whether this can match the pace of warming [@helmEvolutionaryResponseClimate2019; @vanbuskirkPhenotypicPlasticityAlone2012;@charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014; @merilaClimateChangeAdaptation2014]. As changes continue, species will not only need to shift timing but also undergo large-scale distributional changes to track suitable conditions. Climate-induced range shifts have been documented in birds [@ambrosiniClimateChangeLongterm2011; @lehikoinenNorthNorthwestClimate2016; @lasortePolewardShiftsWinter2007; @tingleyPushPullClimate2012], but we lack an understanding of the ecological and behavioral processes that facilitate these shifts. This poses a challenge for predicting how species will respond in the future.

## Flexibility in migration {-}
  
+ Intro to idea of flexibility, why it is important, consequnces and examples
  + Responses on different timescales and by different mechanisms - plastic/behavioral and evolutionary responses
  + Flexibility allows birds to respond to environmental change
  + Biotic cycles, seasonal variation 
  + Movement in a flow - respond, adjust to atmosphere
  + Existing study of flexibility not always easy - 
    + constrained by scope, computation, need for experiments in the lab

- variation/flexibility in migration - where does it come from?
  - Variation among or within individuals? 
  - How much variation? 
  - What are the consequences of variation and flexibility?
  - Responses to environmental cues

+ In this thesis, examine different axes of flexibility in migration. What is known about these axes, and what remains unclear? 

levels of flexibiliy

### Phenotypic plasticity {-}
(in flight responses to conditions, adjusting timing)

### Evolutionary responses {-}
(via change in migratory programme)

#### The innate migratory programme of individuals {-}

+ Evidence for innate control of migration
+ Differs by migratory strategy, distance, species
+ Chronobiology perspectives 
+ Often viewed as the rigid and programmed aspect - instinct driven
+ But evidence that there may actually be more flexibility here than believed 
  + Factors like age (juv vs adult), migration distance/strategy
  + Partial migration - do individuals with different strategies have different programs, or different thresholds, or...?
  + How is the migratory programme inherited? 
+ Migratory programmed believed to be rigid, only possible to respond to evolutionary changes 
  + What potential is there for evolutionary change? 
 
+ Studying the migratory program
  + Lab/field based assays of restlessness behavior
  + Big question: how does the migratory programme relate to actual migration in the wild? Methods may not be perfect - Zug != migration in the wild. 
  + Approaches that explore interspecies/population differences in restlessness and integrates these captive assays to behavior in the wild are particularly valuable for understanding their use in the future



## Migration across scales {-}

+ the importance of integrating perspectives across scales *in science in general*
+ Migration is a complex and interconnected system, and a successful migration requires the integration of numerous components - including habitats across the world, at different times, different places and ecosystems. We need to think about migration *globally.* But not only that - we need to think about migration from the individual to the system level - need a range of perspectives
  + Migratory birds are *individuals* that make decisions, integrating internal programming, internal need, external environmental/social stimuli -- to understand migration and flexibility, responses to climate change, and overall how things work, need to understand how individuals operate. To understand how entire species, and indeed entire migration systems, operate and their capacity for rapid change, need to understand the mechanisms that govern *individual* flexibility 
  + At the same time, we must adopt a *wider perspective* to address some of the most pressing scientific questions of today, including about the conservation status of species, whether they are keeping pace with a range of environmental changes, 
    + e.g. how migration networks behave in the face of habitat loss
    + where are conservation bottlenecks
    + must integrate mortality and understand survival
    + cite radar/Adriaan/etc
    + Other things more directly relevant to my work
  + This requires understanding the behaviour of populations, species, and even the *system* level. Migratory birds form a system of large scale biomass flux and nutrient transport, with consequences for ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, pathogen and parasite transport (e.g. ticks, disease), biotic interactions (pollination). Plus, migratory birds are interconnected. Species move together, communicate in migration, forage in mixed species flocks, and we have little understanding of these links. Migratory birds form part of a global system. To only study migration from an individual perspective would be to miss these important components of avian biology.
  
+ Multiple perspectives not only important in scale, but also in approach and angle - 
  + chronobiology, ecology, evolution, behavior, observation, etc.
