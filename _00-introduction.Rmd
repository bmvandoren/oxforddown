<!-- Flexibility in avian migration across scales -->


Movement links the lives of animals, plants and people to the ever-changing environments of our planet. Migratory birds embody this essence, captivating human imagination and study for millennia while conveying important information about the natural world. [*Some historical anecdotes about the observation of birds - from Aristotle, more recently*]. Such long-running fascination is well-founded, as migratory birds engage in breathtaking feats of navigation, endurance, social coordination, and physiological transformation, culminating in one of nature's most inspiring phenomena.

Today, birds serve as charismatic and accessible indicators of ecosystem health on a hemispheric scale [**refs**]. In recent decades, studies documenting birds' responses to pesticides [ref DDT, neonicitonoids?], invasive species, human development, and climate change [**refs for all**] have led to detailed insight into the impacts of human activity on natural systems. Dangers faced by migratory birds signal broad risks for the natural world because birds provide key services [**ref**] and form integral parts of ecosystems through trophic interactions and the transport of nutrients and propagules [@bauerMigratoryAnimalsCouple2014].

Unfortunately, these global travelers are disappearing under rapidly increasing pressures of a changing world. Understanding the capacity of migratory birds to respond to both established and emerging challenges requires knowledge of the complex interactions among individuals, populations, species, and natural and built environments. Despite millennia of human fascination with migratory birds, we lack an understanding of the flexibility of avian migration across spatial and taxonomic scales, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of this key part of avian life history.

During seasonal migrations, birds form intricate networks of hundreds of species and billions of individuals that fly, forage and communicate, interacting with each other while providing critical services to ecosystems [1].  -->

<!-- Bird migration is a phenomenon that has captivated human imagination and study for millennia and one that provides important information about the natural world. Migratory birds connect continents and peoples, and they are charismatic and accessible indicator species for monitoring ecosystem health on a hemispheric scale (Bryce et al. 2002, Bock and Jones 2004, Devictor et al. 2010). Indeed, birds have already provided important insights into the effects we can expect from a changing climate on the natural world (Kullberg et al. 2015, Miles et al. 2017). Observed changes in the distributions and phenology of  migratory birds signal what will come for less mobile organisms (Walther et al. 2002). In order to accurately predict and ameliorate effects of climate change on the natural world, it is crucial to understand organisms’ flexibility in their movement behaviours.  -->

<!-- Unfortunately, these global travelers are disappearing under rapidly increasing pressures of habitat loss, climate change, and an airspace transformed by light pollution, emergent structures, and vehicles [3–5]. Understanding the complex interactions among individuals, populations, species, and natural and built environments is crucial to identifying ways to ameliorate these impacts. Despite millennia of human fascination with migratory birds, we have little knowledge of how the various components of migration systems fit together, leaving a fundamental gap in our understanding of a key period in the avian annual cycle. -->


## Challenges of a changing world {-}

<!-- (- Their global existance makes birds succeptible) -->

Migrants' finely tuned, global existance makes them susceptible to change, which can occur differently in different places and at different scales. To be successful, a migrant must meet a diverse array of challenges: navigating through a dynamic aymosphere; accurately timing departure, arrival and stopover; efficiently locating resources *en route*; and thriving in diverse ecological contexts. The requirement of integrating these and other components of migration implies that responses to change may require adjusting multiple stages of the migratory process. Birds' abilities to adjust may vary greatly among stages and species. Depending on the nature of the environmental change, some species may have little problem adapting, while others may struggle [**ref** - and briefly what factors influence this?]. 

<!-- (- Summarize threats and changes) -->

Migratory birds face a variety of threats. The habitats birds evolved to occupy are undergoing rapid alterations, caused by habitat loss, climate change, and a proliferation of vehicles, built structures, and artificial lighting [**refs - 3–5**]. Major drivers of land cover change include agriculture, development, and resource extraction [**ref**]. Aerial habitats are also changing, as the numbers of airplanes and skyscrapers rise and populations of insects dwindle [**ref**]. For the majority of migratory birds that migrate at night [**ref**], light pollution compounds this crisis; artificial lighting draws migratory birds into urban areas and is directly responsible for fatal collisions with built structures [**ref**]. Climate change is also contributing to transformed habitats while shifting optimal timing windows, wind regimes, and storm patterns. All of these forces have major consequences for migratory birds, contributing to direct and indirect mortality [**ref mortality stats**] and threatening the integrity of entire ecosystems [**ref?**]. As environmental change proceeds and humans modify both the landscapes through which birds pass and the areas where they breed and winter, a migratory strategy may become increasingly untenable [@wilcoveGoingGoingGone2008;@rungeProtectedAreasGlobal2015]. Migratory birds are in decline across the globe [**refs**].

<!-- [@beresfordPhenologyClimateChange;@bothAvianPopulationConsequences2009;@fraserIndividualVariabilityMigration2019; @sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006].  -->

<!-- (- Already seeing some responses) -->

Fortunately, many species are responding to global change in detectable ways. As the arrival of spring has grown earlier, so too have the spring arrival dates of many migratory bird species [**ref**]. As locations with suitable climatic conditions have shifted, so too have birds' geographic ranges [**ref**]. In some cases, migratory routes have changed or individuals have stopped migrating entirely, as birds take advantage of new and changing resource regimes [**ref** storks, etc.]. It is evident that many bird species possess an ability to rapidly respond to environmental change. At the same time, other species appear to be relatively rigid in their behavior, prompting concerns that even some of the world's most mobile animals will fail to adapt in time [**ref**]. Moreover, what will come of less vagile organisms, many of which birds rely on for food and shelter? We lack a full understanding of the flexibility of migratory birds, and this knowledge is sorely needed.

<!-- (- But is it enough? How flexible are birds...) -->

  
## Flexibility in migration {-}
  
The migrations of birds are highly diverse journeys, undertaken by individuals responding to---and often predicting---changing conditions. Variation in migratory behavior is immense at all taxonomic levels, and even within species and populations. Movements may be long- or short-distance, obligate or facultative, regular or irregular, performed singly or in groups, and rigidly timed or conditions-dependent [**ref**]. This diversity in migratory strategies mirrors large variation in the degree of flexibility migrants demonstrate as they interact with and respond to the vagaries of the natural world. Flexibility in migration manifests at a number of levels: individuals must interact with the atmosphere in active flight, adjust to variable conditions on the ground, and populations must be responsive to environmental changes over the long term. 

<!-- Short-term flexibility -- immediate response to environment during active migration -->

### Responding to a dynamic atmosphere {-}

Migratory birds respond to variation in their environment in a variety of ways. During active migration, birds move through a dynamic atmosphere, a flowing medium that often moves faster than a bird can fly. Atmospheric dynamics are highly changeable, and they can strongly affect a bird's flight trajectory, energy expenditure, and ultimately its survival [**ref alerstam**]. All avian navigators most possess the capability to effectively and efficiently interact with a variable atmosphere, or risk costly and potentially fatal detours. Indeed, birds are frequently selective with the time, direction, and altitude of their movements [**refs**]. The decision to migrate is influenced strongly by wind and weather conditions, as birds select departure times with favorable or even optimal conditions for progress towards their destinations [**refs**]. Yet prevailing wind regimes and the time pressure of a relentlessly advancing year mean that birds cannot always be selective. As powered fliers, birds have the ability to partially or fully compensate for wind drift incurred during migratory flights, and they show complex interactions with moving atmospheric flows. Frequently, birds adopt a compensatory strategy, and the degree to which migrants fight the wind is influenced by a range of factors, including body size, time pressure, wind conditions, and the potential dangers of being drifted off course---for example, over open ocean [**ref** - NE US paper]. Migrants respond not only to wind but strongly to temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure [**refs**], cues that contain predictive information about the conditions they will experience both *en route* and upon arrival. As weather conditions are often variable, migrants must be flexible enough to respond to changing conditions and adjust their journeys accordingly in order to stay on course and minimize delays. 

<!-- Examples?? -->

<!-- Medium-term flexibility -- adjusting of e.g. timing based on environmental cues, like a colder or warmer spring.  -->

### Adjusting to a variable environment {-}

  + Migration is an adaptation to a seasonal environment [**ref Winger**]
  + Seasons are generally predictable, as predictable as the number of rotations the earth will complete in 365 days
  + Yet there is considerable variation from year to year -- and with climate change, we are seeing increased variability as well, e.g. with the time of spring
  + Birds must exhibit flexibility that allow them to respond 
  + Phenotypic plasticity well documented in some migratory birds - timing advances with climate change, range shifts 
  + Short-distance migrants are the most flexible 

<!-- Longer-term flexibility -- evolutionary change to changing climatic regimes and land use paradigms, ice age, range expansion - recapitulation of migratory routes -->

### Adapting to long-term change {-}

  + Long term environmental changes like climate change, ice age cycles, new habitat -- cannot rely on plasticity, need evolutionary change
  + Long distance migrants have rigidly programmed timing programmes, in addition to inherited navigation programs 
  + Yet it is unclear 
  
<!-- Summary and open questions -->

  + Migrants show immense flexibility, hard to grasp
  + Where does flexibility come from? How much of response is evolutionary? 

<!-- Existing study of flexibility not always easy -- constrained by scope, computation, need for experiments in the lab -->

### Phenotypic plasticity {-}

### Evolutionary responses {-}

#### The innate migratory programme of individuals {-}

+ Evidence for innate control of migration
+ Differs by migratory strategy, distance, species
+ Chronobiology perspectives 
+ Often viewed as the rigid and programmed aspect - instinct driven
+ But evidence that there may actually be more flexibility here than believed 
  + Factors like age (juv vs adult), migration distance/strategy
  + Partial migration - do individuals with different strategies have different programs, or different thresholds, or...?
  + How is the migratory programme inherited? 
+ Migratory programmed believed to be rigid, only possible to respond to evolutionary changes 
  + What potential is there for evolutionary change? 
 
+ Studying the migratory program
  + Lab/field based assays of restlessness behavior
  + Big question: how does the migratory programme relate to actual migration in the wild? Methods may not be perfect - Zug != migration in the wild. 
  + Approaches that explore interspecies/population differences in restlessness and integrates these captive assays to behavior in the wild are particularly valuable for understanding their use in the future







The diversity in migratory strategies is mirrored in the ease with which individual can adapt to change


<!-- but they are particularly susceptible to environmental change because successful migration requires the integration of a number of disparate components, each one sensitive to ongoing changes that may be poorly correlated. Migrants must time their journeys precisely, navigate accurately through a dynamic atmosphere, locate resources safely, reliably and efficiently, and thrive in ecological contexts that differ across seasons and hemispheres. As climate change shifts optimal timing windows, wind regimes, storm patterns, and as humans modify both the landscapes through which birds pass and the areas where they breed and winter, a migratory strategy may become increasingly untenable [@wilcoveGoingGoingGone2008;@rungeProtectedAreasGlobal2015]. Migrant birds are in decline in multiple regions, in part because many lack the flexibility to rapidly respond and adapt to these large scale environmental changes [@beresfordPhenologyClimateChange;@bothAvianPopulationConsequences2009;@fraserIndividualVariabilityMigration2019; @sandersonLongtermPopulationDeclines2006].  -->

<!-- Whether migratory species have the capacity to adjust to rapid change is a focal question of current research. Although plasticity in response to climate change is well documented [@gienappResponsesClimateChange2007; @usuiTemporalShiftsTemperature2017], many migratory birds, especially long-distance travelers, rely on innate timing and navigational programs with limited flexibility [@akessonTimingAvianLongdistance2017; @gwinnerCircannualClocksAvian1996]. These programs must undergo evolution for adjustments to be realized. There is some evidence that microevolutionary change---not just plasticity---may be occuring, but it is unclear whether this can match the pace of warming [@helmEvolutionaryResponseClimate2019; @vanbuskirkPhenotypicPlasticityAlone2012;@charmantierClimateChangeTiming2014; @merilaClimateChangeAdaptation2014]. As changes continue, species will not only need to shift timing but also undergo large-scale distributional changes to track suitable conditions. Climate-induced range shifts have been documented in birds [@ambrosiniClimateChangeLongterm2011; @lehikoinenNorthNorthwestClimate2016; @lasortePolewardShiftsWinter2007; @tingleyPushPullClimate2012], but we lack an understanding of the ecological and behavioral processes that facilitate these shifts. This poses a challenge for predicting how species will respond in the future. -->


## Migration across scales {-}

+ the importance of integrating perspectives across scales *in science in general*
+ Migration is a complex and interconnected system, and a successful migration requires the integration of numerous components - including habitats across the world, at different times, different places and ecosystems. We need to think about migration *globally.* But not only that - we need to think about migration from the individual to the system level - need a range of perspectives
  + Migratory birds are *individuals* that make decisions, integrating internal programming, internal need, external environmental/social stimuli -- to understand migration and flexibility, responses to climate change, and overall how things work, need to understand how individuals operate. To understand how entire species, and indeed entire migration systems, operate and their capacity for rapid change, need to understand the mechanisms that govern *individual* flexibility 
  + At the same time, we must adopt a *wider perspective* to address some of the most pressing scientific questions of today, including about the conservation status of species, whether they are keeping pace with a range of environmental changes, 
    + e.g. how migration networks behave in the face of habitat loss
    + where are conservation bottlenecks
    + must integrate mortality and understand survival
    + cite radar/Adriaan/etc
    + Other things more directly relevant to my work
  + This requires understanding the behaviour of populations, species, and even the *system* level. Migratory birds form a system of large scale biomass flux and nutrient transport, with consequences for ecosystem services, nutrient cycling, pathogen and parasite transport (e.g. ticks, disease), biotic interactions (pollination). Plus, migratory birds are interconnected. Species move together, communicate in migration, forage in mixed species flocks, and we have little understanding of these links. Migratory birds form part of a global system. To only study migration from an individual perspective would be to miss these important components of avian biology.
  
+ Multiple perspectives not only important in scale, but also in approach and angle - 
  + chronobiology, ecology, evolution, behavior, observation, etc.
