## Determinants of flexibility in the face of change {-}

Migratory birds are a global network of organisms that connect the world's ecosystems. For millions of years, natural selection has shaped the migrations of birds to changing continents, climates, and communities. Today, global climate and land cover changes are transforming the world's ecosystems, but at an increasingly alarming rate. Organisms are responding, but they may not be adapting fast enough [@devictorBirdsAreTracking2008; @devictorDifferencesClimaticDebts2012; @mayorIncreasingPhenologicalAsynchrony2017].

In this thesis, I have explored several perspectives on change and flexibility in avian migration, focusing on the contributions of the innate migratory program, birds' responses to environmental cues and conditions, and the influence of human activity on migratory behavior. In **chapter \@ref(stonechats)**, I demonstrated that stonechats (genus *Saxicola*) possess inherited migratory programs that vary predictably among taxa according to their migratory behavior. However, these programs are not the sole determinant of migratory phenotype, especially among partial migrants, implying that environmental factors can readily interact with the inherited program to influence migratory phenotypes. In **chapter \@ref(flycatchers)**, I combined field and laboratory studies to present evidence of changes in the innate migratory program of a long-distance migrant, the pied flycatcher (*Ficedula hypoleuca*), showing that ongoing responses of migratory birds to climate change can involve not only phenotypic plasticity, but microevolutionary change as well. In **chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)**, I examined variation in the migratory behavior of the Eurasian blackcap (*Sylvia atricapilla*) across its European range, illustrating two different ways that natural selection can act on songbird migration: (1) to maintain opposing migratory strategies over short distances, in the case of a migratory divide,  and (2) to enable the spread of a novel strategy across a wide range, in the case of individuals wintering in the British Isles. In **chapter \@ref(forecast)**, I showed that migratory flexibility is important not only on evolutionary timescales, but also to enable short-term responses to variable environmental conditions during active migratory flights. These responses are predictable enough to reliably forecast avian movements across the contiguous United States. In **chapter \@ref(lights)**, I examined how artificial light at night can drastically affect migratory journeys, an important example of anthropogenic impacts on bird migration. Finally, in **chapter \@ref(blackcap-uk)**, I returned to the blackcap to show how human activity can impact not only migrants' in-flight behaviors, but also shape their broader ecology. Overall, this body of work shows that migratory birds' flexibility stems from a range of sources, innate and external, and that the presence of variation in migratory phenotype may be key to enabling responses to environmental change.

<!--   + Passerine migrants have hard coded programs (ch 1). In some species their rigidity may hinder rapid responses to change. Yet I find evidence that evolutionary change may be occurring even in a species with well documented rigidity (ch 2). However, it is unclear whether change is occurring fast enough. Indeed, I examine blackcaps, a species that is thriving despite change, and I find strong evidence for flexibility in their movements and ecology (ch 3 and 6). This flexibility appears to be driven by the large variation present in this species. Lesson: variation is key to adaptation. Darwin.  -->

## Impacts of human activities on bird migration {-}

This thesis examines two examples of anthropogenic impacts on bird migration systems. The first is the behavioral alterations caused by the proliferation of artificial light at night. It is not known why migratory birds are attracted or disorientated by light pollution, but its negative influence on birds has been known for some time [@allenDestructionBirdsLighthouses1880]. Impacts of light pollution on birds can be severe and acute, as in cases of mass attraction and potentially mass mortality [e.g. **Chapter \@ref(lights)**, @richEcologicalConsequencesArtificial2013]. However, this is not the only way light pollution can impact avian migrants. Recent research suggests that light at night may influence the behavior of migrating birds across a landscape scale, drawing them towards urbanized areas where suitable terrestrial habitats can be scarce [@mclarenArtificialLightNight2018]. Fortunately, action to reduce light pollution can have immediate positive impacts and allow migrants to continue their flights unhindered (**Chapter \@ref(lights)**). Mitigation should focus on urban areas, which generate a disproportionate amount of light pollution---especially those along key migratory corridors [@hortonBrightLightsBig2019]. [**reference as appendix?**] Through migration forecasts (**Chapter \@ref(forecast)**), alerts could be established that warn of upcoming large migration events in time for people to turn off non-essential lighting. 

Human activity has transformed much of the world and profoundly influenced the course of evolution of wild organisms [@palumbiHumansWorldGreatest2001; @boivinEcologicalConsequencesHuman2016; @sullivanHumanBehaviourLongterm2017]. Urbanization in particular has driven major phenotypic changes [@albertiGlobalUrbanSignatures2017] as organisms adapt to a human-dominated environment. Yet the Anthropocene is here to stay, and one consequence of human activity is the creation of new opportunities for wildlife to exploit. An obvious example of this phenomenon is the proliferation of supplemental feeding, which can have a range of impacts on the populations and behavior of wildlife [@galbraithSupplementaryFeedingRestructures2015; @coxHumanNatureInteractions2018; @plummerCompositionBritishBird2019]. This is especially true for birds, which are frequent beneficiaries of food provisioning. At least 45% percent of households feed birds in a number of countries, with higher provisioning rates in the United Kingdom [@galbraithRisksDriversWild2014; @daviesHouseholdFactorsInfluencing2012; @orrosWildBirdFeeding2015]. In the UK, this behavior is an important determinant of wintering blackcap presence and a driver of their behavior [**Chapter \@ref(blackcap-uk)**, @plummerSupplementaryFeedingGardens2015; @plummerCompositionBritishBird2019]. Garden bird feeding has likely facilitated the growth of the winter blackcap population by increasing winter survival, especially during harsh conditions when energy demands are high [**Chapter \@ref(blackcap-uk)**, @plummerSupplementaryFeedingGardens2015]. This example demonstrates how a bird species with sufficient flexibility in migratory behavior can take advantage of novel resources. Blackcaps are not the only species adjusting migration in response to human-mediated changes in resource availability; species as diverse as white storks (*Ciconia ciconia*) and hummingbirds (Trochilidae) have adopted modified, shorter migrations [@satterfieldResponsesMigratorySpecies2018]. Such highly flexible species are notable because of the speed of their response, and these examples may foreshadow similar ecological shifts in the future.

  




  <!-- + Is it all bad? -->
  <!--   + Blackcaps in the UK -- clear that human activity is influencing ecology and behavior of blackcaps (ch 3, ch 6). Is this bad? One could argue that they are filling a new niche. Humans are transforming the globe, and species that can take advantage of new opportunities will be the ones that survive.  (Is it bad to feed them? I don't think so.) -->
  <!--   + These highly flexible species are the first ones showing strong responses to climate change, but they likely preview the coming situation for other species that are slower to adjust (?) -->
  <!--   + So not all bad - for species that are flexible. For species that are less flexible, however, this is likely to be a major problem, and good evidence that a lack of flexibility is a major predictor of declines (cite pied fly, etc.). I provide evidence that pied flys and potentially other rigidly timed species can show evolutionary responses to changing phenology across multidecadal timescales (ch 2), but the overwhelming(?) evidence of declined linked to a lack of flexibility suggests that climate change may be outstripping the adjustment capacity of many species. [Potentially also cite Gulf work that shows no overall change in timing, potentially because of rigid timing programs?] -->
  
## Taking insights from the lab to the field---and back {-}  
  
Laboratory studies of migratory behavior have led to foundational insights into bird migration, including how migratory birds use the sun, stars, magnetic field, and polarized light to orient [@emlenMigratoryOrientationIndigo1967; @wiltschkoEvidenceInnateMagnetic1974; @alerstamRoleGeomagneticField1983; @akessonHowMigrantsGet2007]. Laboratory studies have also shown that songbirds' migratory behavior is innate and inherited [@bertholdGeneticControlMigratory1991; @helbigInheritanceMigratoryDirection1991] and even how birds respond to wind drift [@ableOrientationPasserineNocturnal1977; @mooreEvidenceRedeterminationMigratory1990]. At the same time, laboratory studies of migration can be limiting simply because they are based on the behavior of caged birds, not free-flying individuals. Exactly how closely lab-derived assays correlate with wild phenotypes is still an open question, but recent research has shown that the migratory restlessness behavior of birds held in captivity may not always be directly comparable to migration in the wild. For example, resident populations may show migratory restlessness [@helmMigratoryRestlessnessEquatorial2006], and migrants that show restlessness every night in captivity may only undertake infrequent flights in the wild [@zunigaAbruptSwitchMigratory2016; @backmanActivityMigratoryFlights2017]. 

This thesis affirms the value of laboratory experiments for studying migration while also illustrating why scientists should be cautious in the extent of inference drawn from these proxies of wild migratory behavior. In **chapter \@ref(flycatchers)**, I showed that the spring timing advances of captive-raised pied flycatchers were of a similar magnitude to those observed in a nearby wild population. In this case, the wild and laboratory-derived data were highly complementary: by excluding plasticity as a source of timing differences, the captive study provided key insight into change in the wild population, while at the same time affirming the relevance of laboratory data for understanding wild processes. Similarly, blackcap migration has been extensively studied in a laboratory setting, and **chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)** provides an opportunity to compare previous lab-derived insights to new migration tracks of wild birds. Captive breeding experiments between blackcap populations with southwest and southeast migratory directions found that their offspring showed a spread of intermediate migratory directions [@helbigInheritanceMigratoryDirection1991], and the directions of tracked birds from the contact zone (**Chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)**) were highly similar to the distribution of directions from the experiment. However, it is important to note that these tracks were from adult blackcaps originating in the migratory divide, while Helbig measured the offspring of parental populations captured away from the contact zone. In another instance, orientation experiments with British winterers found a broadly west-northwesterly autumn orientation, in contrast to the southwesterly orientation of German blackcaps [@bertholdRapidMicroevolutionMigratory1992]. Geolocator results showed that British winterers indeed migrate west and northwest to Britain from continental breeding areas (**Chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)**). Finally, a captive timing experiment found that blackcaps exposed to British photoperiods initiated migration on average five days earlier than those exposed to Mediterranean photoperiods, estimating that birds wintering in these two areas would arrive on the breeding grounds 16 days apart due to the shorter migration durations of British winterers [@terrillEcophysiologicalAspectsRapid1990]. Results from wild-tracked blackcaps were broadly consistent with this result, yielding estimates of a six-day difference in departure and ten-day difference in arrival. Taken together, these results generally affirm the utility of laboratory experiments in the study avian migratory behavior. 

Despite clear consistency between laboratory results and the behavior of wild-tracked migrants, this thesis also highlights the caution needed when drawing inferences from laboratory proxies of migration. In **chapter \@ref(stonechats)**, I showed that the migratory phenotypes of wild populations do not necessarily align with activity measures dervied from migratory restlessness data. In that chapter, Irish stonechats, which are partial migrants, showed intensities of spring migratory restlessness that were indistinguishable from those of Siberian stonechats, which are obligate long-distance migrants. In addition, I found changes in activity with age, which might be related to habituation or senescence. In blackcaps, although tracking results in **chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)** were consistent with many insights derived from experiments in captivity (see previous paragraph), these experiments provided an incomplete picture. Orientation studies could not have determined that many blackcaps migrating south from the migratory divide would winter north of the Sahara; those experiments concluded that a southerly migration direction would result in low survival [@helbigInheritanceMigratoryDirection1991], when in reality this direction is used by a large fraction of birds in the divide. As a last example, Terrill and Berthold [-@terrillEcophysiologicalAspectsRapid1990] used an average migration rate of 45 km to estimate that British winterers would take 24 days to travel from Britain to Germany on spring migration. However, data from **chapter \@ref(blackcap-geo)** indicated that spring migration durations of British winterers were often only a few days long. Overall, care is necessary when interpreting results from laboratory proxies of migration behavior.
